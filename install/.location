# Complete Guide to Installing n8n on Windows

This guide will help you quickly and easily install n8n on your Windows computer using our `install_n8n_windows.exe` installer.

## Step 1: Preparation

1.  **Download the Installer**: Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/JohnKlad/n8n-one-click/releases) page and download the `install_n8n_windows.exe` file.
2.  **Get Your License Key**: If you don't have one yet, [purchase it here](https://your-payment-provider.com/link-to-product). The key will be sent to your email address.

## Step 2: Running the Installer

1.  **Run `install_n8n_windows.exe`**.
    *   *Note*: Windows might show a "Windows protected your PC" warning. Click "More info," then "Run anyway." This is standard behavior for new applications.

2.  **Enter Your License Key**:
    *   A window will pop up asking for your license key.
    *   Paste the key you copied from your email and click "OK."
    *   The script will validate the key.

## Step 3: Automatic Installation

After key validation, the installer will handle everything else for you:

1.  **Docker Check and Installation**:
    *   The script will check if **Docker Desktop** is installed on your computer.
    *   **If Docker is not found**: The installer will automatically download and start the Docker Desktop installation. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it. A computer restart may be required. After restarting, simply run `install_n8n_windows.exe` again.
    *   **If Docker is found but not running**: The installer will ask you to start Docker Desktop. Open it from the Start Menu and wait for the whale icon in the system tray to stop animating.

2.  **Downloading and Running n8n**:
    *   The installer will download the latest version of n8n and configure it for local use.
    *   This process will take a few minutes.

## Step 4: All Done!

*   Once the installation is complete, your browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:5678`.
*   On this page, you will need to create an administrator account for your n8n instance. This is your personal, local instance!

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

*   **"Invalid License Key" Error**:
    *   Ensure you copied the key completely, with no extra spaces.
    *   Check if the key has expired.

*   **Docker Fails to Start**:
    *   Ensure virtualization (VT-x/AMD-V) is enabled in your computer's BIOS.
    *   Check that you have enough RAM (8 GB is recommended).
    *   Try restarting Docker Desktop.
